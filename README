typoscan is a utility to create to-do lists from Wikipedia
dumps for AutoWikiBrowser.

It retrieves a list of regular expressions to scan for from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AWB/T, reads a dump file on
STDIN, and outputs a list of all page titles that match on
any of the regular expressions to STDOUT.  Diagnostic output
is directed to STDERR.

AWB ignores some article parts like <nowiki> tags, so there
may be false positives.
