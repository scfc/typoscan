The territory of today's Algeria was the home of many ancient prehistoric cultures, including [[Aterian]] and [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] cultures. Its area has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient Berber [[Numidia]]ns, [[Punic|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Arab [[Umayyad]]s, Berber [[Fatimid]]s, Berber [[Almoravids]], Berber [[Almohads]] and later [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] Ottomans.

==Etymology==
The country's name derives from the city of [[Algiers]]. The most common etymology links the city name to ''al-Jazā'ir'' (الجزائر, &quot;The Islands&quot;), a truncated form of the city's older name ''Jazā'ir Banī Mazghanna'' (جزائر بني مزغنة, &quot;Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe&quot;),&lt;ref name=idrisi&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Idrisi|first=Muhammad|title=Nuzhat al-Mushtaq|year=12th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref name=khaldun&gt;{{cite book|last=Abderahman|first=Abderrahman|title=History of Ibn Khaldun – Volume 6|year=1377}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} employed by medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]]. Others {{who|date=September 2011}} trace it to ''Ldzayer'', the [[Maghrebi Arabic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]] for &quot;Algeria&quot; possibly related to the [[Zirid Dynasty]] King [[Ziri ibn-Manad]] and founder of the city of Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/13243273/Etymologie-du-toponyme-Aldjazair |title=Etymologie du toponyme &quot;Aldjazair&quot; |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient history===
{{main|Prehistoric North Africa|North Africa during Antiquity}}
[[File:Tassili ladies.jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Tassili]] rock paintings dating from about 3000 BC relating a probably lost civilization in what was known as the [[Green Sahara]]]]
At Ain Hanech region ([[Saïda Province]]), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |title=The Site of Ain Hanech Revisited: New Investigations at this Lower Pleistocene Site in Northern Algeria |publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science |date= |coauthors=Mohamed Sahnouni; Jean de Heinzelin |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |title=Research at Ain Hanech, Algeria |publisher=Stoneageinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.

The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berbers|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|chapter=Berbers in Antiquity|isbn=978-0-631-20767-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8Zcz91t29ukC|accessdate=2 February 2010|author=Brett, Michael; Fentress, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GM Djemila Roman Theatre02.jpg|thumbnail|left|Ancient Roman theatre in Djémila]]

From their principal center of power at Carthage, the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Numidia along with Egypt, Rome, and Carthage 200 BCE]]

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Massinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. The Vandals of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Ward-Perkins|first2=Bryan|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qf8mrHjfZRoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA124|accessdate=2013-02-28|volume=14|date=2001-03-29|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32591-2|pages=124–126|chapter=Vandal Africa, 429-533}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not make any significant settlement on the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;/&gt; The region was later recaptured by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which ruled it until the [[Muslim Conquest]] in the 7th century.

===Middle Ages===
{{main|Medieval Muslim Algeria}}

[[File:FatimidCaliphate969.png|thumbnail|left|Fatimid Caliphate 969 A.D.]]
When Muslim [[Arabs]] arrived in Algeria in the mid-7th century, a large number of locals converted to the new faith. After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] Arab Dynasty in 751, numerous local Berber dynasties emerged. Amongst those dynasties were the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]] and the [[Fatimids]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} converted the Berber [[Kutama]] of the [[Petite Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the [[Rustamid]]s, and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid vassals]]. When the latter rebelled, the Shia Fatimids sent in the [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] Arabian tribes who unexpectedly defeated the [[Zirid]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Berber people controlled much of the [[Maghreb]] region throughout the Middle Ages. The Berbers were made up of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], Houaras, [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], Kutama, Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes were independent and made territorial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane| trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |page=XV |accessdate=28 February 2009|author1=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in Maghreb, Sudan, Andalusia, Sicily, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Egypt, and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarizing the Zirid, [[Banu Ifran]], [[Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], Abdalwadid, [[Wattasid]], [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR115|title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |pages=X |accessdate=28 February 2009|author1=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts ([[presidio]]s) on or near the Algerian coast. Spain took control of [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1505; [[Oran]] in 1509; and [[Tlemcen]], [[Mostaganem]], and [[Ténès]], in 1510. In the same year, the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Offensive|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Algeria===
{{main|Ottoman Algeria}}
[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|[[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]]]]
In 1516 the Muslim privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin subdued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot; /&gt;

In 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty notables. It was at first dominated by the''[[ojaq]]''; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role. Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there.&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot; /&gt;

The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;csa16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria - Ottoman Rule|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/16.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1815). Following those wars, Algeria was weaker, and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]], [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|attacked Algiers]]. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by [[Stephen Decatur|Decatur]] (US navy) concerning the demands of tributes.

From 1848 until independence, [[France]] administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and département of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants, who became known as ''colons'' and later, as ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noir]]s.''

Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the [[Algerian War]] began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 [[Harkis]] and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] (FLN) or by [[lynching|lynch]] mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=French 'Reparation' for Algerians | date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 [[Evian agreements]] and the July 1962 [[Algerian self-determination referendum, 1962|self-determination referendum]].

===Independence===
[[File:Houari Boumedienne (1966) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|left|Houari Boumedienne (1966)]]
{{main|History of Algeria (1962–1999)}}
Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. Morocco's claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by [[Houari Boumédienne]], his former ally and defense minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]]; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He [[collective farming|collectivised]] agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international [[1973 oil crisis]].

In the 1960s and 1970s under President [[Houari Boumediene]], Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of [[Arabisation]] in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Prochaska|first=David|title=That Was Then, This Is Now: The Battle of Algiers and After.|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhr/summary/v085/85.1prochaska.html|page=141|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the [[Front Islamique du Salut]] (FIS), a broad coalition of Islamist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

===Civil War and aftermath===
{{main|Algerian Civil War}}
In December 1991 the [[Front Islamique du Salut]] dominated the first of two rounds of [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|legislative elections]]. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a [[High Council of State (Algeria)|High Council of State]] was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil [[insurgency]] between its armed wing, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Algeria held [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|elections in 1999]], which were won by President [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]]. He worked to restore political stability to the country  and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a [[Algerian Civil Concord referendum, 1999|referendum]], under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The [[Groupe Salafiste pour la Prédication et le Combat]] (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

Bouteflika was re-elected in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2004|April 2004 presidential election]] after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the [[Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation]], which was approved in a [[Algerian national reconciliation referendum, 2005|referendum in September 2005]]. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

In November 2008, the [[Algerian Constitution]] was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the [[Algerian presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential elections]], and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot; /&gt;

A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar [[Arab Spring|protests across the Middle East and North Africa]]. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration?_s=PM:WORLD | title = Algeria Officially Lifts State of Emergency |publisher=CNN |date=24 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110301134330/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-24/world/algeria.emergency_1_islamist-party-algerian-press-service-emergency-declaration?_s=PM:WORLD| archivedate= 1 March 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaeo&quot; /&gt; In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;faco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Profile: Algeria|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/country-profile/middle-east-north-africa/algeria?profile=all|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria relief.png|thumb|The [[Sahara]], the [[Ahaggar Mountains|Ahaggar]] and the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] mountains compose the Algerian relief]]
Algeria is the largest country in [[Africa]], the [[Arab world]], and the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the [[Sahara]]. To the north, the [[Tell Atlas]] form with the [[Saharan Atlas]], further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of [[Aures]] and [[Tebessa|Nememcha]] occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is [[Mount Tahat]] ({{formatnum: 3003}} m).

Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape ending with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of [[Tamanghasset]]. Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], [[Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

=== Climate and hydrology ===
{{Main|Climate of Algeria}}
[[File:Hoggar8.jpg|thumb|An oasis in the [[Hoggar]]]]
In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest official temperature was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F}} at In Salah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extreme Weather&amp;nbsp;– A Guide and Record Book|url=http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm|publisher=W.W. Norton Press|author=MHerrera.org and Burt, Christopher C.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mgEKD3NJ|archivedate=10 January 2010|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. [[Prevailing winds]] that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

=== Fauna and Flora ===
{{Main|Wildlife of Algeria}}
[[File:Cèdre du Chélia 13 (Algeria).jpg|thumb|left|[[Cedrus]] of Chélia in the [[Aures]]]]
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes [[coastal]], [[mountainous]] and grassy [[desert]]-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild [[boar]]s, [[jackal]]s, and [[gazelle]]s, although it is not uncommon to spot [[fennecs]] (foxes), and [[jerboas]]. Algeria also has a few [[leopard|panther]], [[leopard]] and [[cheetah]] populations, but these are seldom seen.

A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. [[Barbary macaque]]s are the sole native monkey. [[Snake]]s, [[monitor lizard]]s, and numerous other [[reptile]]s can be found living among an array of [[rodent]]s throughout the [[semi arid]] regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, among which the [[Barbary lion]]s and bears.

In the north, some of the native flora includes [[Macchia]] scrub, [[olive trees]], [[oak]]s, [[cedrus|cedar]]s and other [[conifers]]. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens ([[Aleppo pine]], [[juniper]], and [[evergreen oak]]) and some deciduous trees. [[Ficus|Fig]], [[eucalyptus]], [[agave]], and various [[palm trees]] grow in the warmer areas. The [[grape vine]] is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. [[Acacias]] with wild [[olives]] are the predominant flora in the remainder of the [[Sahara]].

[[Camels]] are used extensively; the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous [[snakes]], [[scorpion]]s, and numerous insects.

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Algeria}}
[[File:Hémicycle de l'assemblée populaire nationale (Algérie).jpg|thumb|The [[People's National Assembly]]]]
Algeria is an [[authoritarian regime]], according to the [[Democracy Index|Democracy Index 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Democracy Index 2010 | url=http://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf|work=eiu.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Freedom of the Press (report)|Freedom of the Press 2009]] report gives it rating &quot;Not Free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Freedom of the Press 2009 | url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fop/2009/FreedomofthePress2009_tables.pdf | publisher=[[Freedom House]] | accessdate=7 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090520232850/http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/fop/2009/FreedomofthePress2009_tables.pdf| archivedate= 20 May 2009 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military &quot;décideurs&quot;, known as &quot;le pouvoir&quot; (&quot;the power&quot;), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be [[Mohamed Mediène]], head of the military intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Still waiting for real democracy|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21554565|publisher=The Economist|date=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired.

===Military===
{{Main|Military of Algeria}}
[[File:Algerian Sailors conduct Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO).jpg|thumb|Algerian sailors conducting [[maritime interdiction]] operations]]
The military of Algeria consists of the [[People's National Army]] (ANP), the [[Algerian National Navy]] (MRA), and the [[Algerian Air Force]] (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; It is the direct successor of the [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial [[military occupation|occupation]] during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62).

Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2008 |author=Hackett, James (ed.)|others= [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] |date=5 February 2008|publisher=Europa |isbn=978-1-85743-461-3| url=http://www.zawya.com/printstory.cfm?storyid=v51n20-1TS05&amp;l=134200080519|accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 18 months (six training and 12 in civil projects).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB/&gt; or 3.3% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 [[MiG-29]]SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion. It also agreed to return old [[aircraft]] purchased from the [[former USSR]].

== Provinces and districts ==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is usually the largest city.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are:&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|Graphical depiction of the country's exports in 28 colour-coded categories.]]
Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/CLASS.XLS |title=World Bank list of economies |date= January 2011 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past five years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$ 286 billion, 40% of which  will go to human development.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3.1% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 3.9% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$ 182.2 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFW4A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Algeria: Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Making Finance Work for Africa |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.93 billion, 62.46% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus. In general, the country exported $73.39 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46.45 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.nuqudy.com/General_Overview/North_Africa/Algeria_Non-Oil_Exp-676 |title=Algeria Non-Oil Exports Surge 41% |publisher=nuqudy.com |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in [[foreign currency reserves]] and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's [[List of countries by external debt|external debt]] is extremely low at about 2% of GDP.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; About 14% of the labor force are employed in the [[Agriculture in Algeria|agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

Algeria has not joined the [[WTO]], despite several years of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing Business in Algeria|url=http://algiers.usembassy.gov/doing_business_algeria.html|publisher=Embassy of the United States Algiers, Algeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an [[OPEC]] member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe.&lt;ref name=opb15&gt;{{cite web|title=OPEC Bulletin 8-9/12|url=http://www.opec.org/opec_web/flipbook/OB08092012/OB08092012/assets/basic-html/page17.html|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|10th-largest reserves of natural gas]] in the world and is the [[List of countries by natural gas exports|sixth-largest gas exporter]]. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft}} of proven [[natural gas reserves|natural-gas reserves]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html |title=Country Comparison: Natural Gas – Proved Reserves |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also ranks [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|16th in oil reserves]].&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.&lt;ref name=imfart4/&gt;

Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt; Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011 and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The Algerian national oil company is [[Sonatrach]], which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Analysis Briefs - Algeria|url=http://www.eia.gov/cabs/Algeria/pdf.pdf|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour market===
Despite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high.&lt;ref name=imfart4&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria: 2011 Article IV Consultation|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1220.pdf|publisher=IMF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15-24 age group.&lt;ref name=aaeo/&gt;

The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programmes introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the  programme to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle).&lt;ref name=aaeo&gt;{{cite web|title=Algeria|url=http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/countries/north-africa/algeria/|publisher=African Economic Outlook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in Algeria}}
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.

There are several [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] in Algeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/dz|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Al Qal'a of Beni Hammad]], the first capital of the [[Hammadid]] empire; [[Tipasa]], a Phoenician and later Roman town; and [[Djémila]] and [[Timgad]], both [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ruins; [[M'Zab Valley]], a limestone valley containing a large urbanized [[oasis]]; also the [[Casbah]] of Algiers is an important citadel. The only natural [[World Heritage Sites]] is the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]], a mountain range.

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Algeria}}
[[File:Autoroute est ouest ghomri2.JPG|thumb|The main highway relaying the Moroccan to the Tunisian borders, was a part of the [[Cairo–Dakar Highway]] project]]
The Algerian road network is the most dense of the [[Africa]]n continent, its length is estimated at 180,000&amp;nbsp;km of highways, with a rate of more than 3 756 structures and coating of 85%. This network should be complemented by a major highway infrastructure being completed, the East-West Highway. It is a 3-way 1 216&amp;nbsp;km, linking the city of [[Annaba]] in the extreme east to the city of [[Tlemcen]] in the far West. Algeria is also crossed by the [[Trans-Sahara Highway]], which is now totally paved. This road is pushed forward by the Algerian Government to increase trade between the six countries crossed (Algeria, [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]] and [[Tunisia]]).

Algerian painters, like [[:fr:Mohamed Racim|Mohamed Racim]] or Baya, attempted to revive the prestigious Algerian past prior to French colonization, at the same time that they have contributed to the preservation of the authentic values of Algeria. In this line, Mohamed Temam,Abdelkhader Houamel have also returned through this art, scenes from the history of the country, the habits and customs of the past and the country life. Other new artistic currents including the one of [[M'hamed Issiakhem]], [[Mohammed Khadda]] and Bachir Yelles, appeared on the scene of Algerian painting, abandoning figurative classical painting to find new pictorial ways, in order to adapt Algerian paintings to the new realities of the country through its struggle and its aspirations. [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khadda.com/ |title=Mohammed Khadda |publisher=Khadda.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Algerian literature|List of Algerian writers}}

The historic roots of Algerian literature goes back to the [[Numidia]]n era, when [[Apuleius]] wrote [[The Golden Ass]], the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety. This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]] among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionized the Arab world literature with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]] and [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]] who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.

[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French pied-noir author. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].

Today Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.

As a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the ''Algerian trilogy'' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even ''Nedjma'' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], [[Ibn Badis]], Mohamed Laïd Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].

Currently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, ''the swallows of Kabul'' and ''the attack'' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], ''the oath of barbarians'' of [[Boualem Sansal]], ''memory of the flesh'' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar ''nowhere in my father's House''.

Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to &quot;improved sanitation&quot;. According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of &quot;reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015&quot;. Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
